# 0. Foreword

The Reasoning Integrity Standard (RIS) defines a formal framework for evaluating, governing, and maintaining the integrity of reasoning performed by large language models (LLMs), autonomous agents, and multi-model cognitive systems.

This standard was developed by Atom Labs to address the absence of authoritative, measurable criteria for assessing the stability and trustworthiness of LLM reasoning in production environments. As AI systems increasingly perform high-impact decision-making across enterprise, regulatory, and safety-critical contexts, the industry requires an auditable, repeatable, and model-agnostic method for measuring reasoning reliability.

RIS establishes a multi-level maturity model (RIS-0 through RIS-4) along with normative controls governing chain-of-thought stability, semantic coherence, drift detection, governance, and reasoning boundary enforcement. It specifies the requirements necessary for organizations to assess the integrity of reasoning workflows under real-world operational and adversarial conditions.

This standard is intended for:

- enterprise architects deploying AI systems
- safety and governance teams responsible for LLM oversight
- auditors and compliance personnel evaluating AI risk posture
- engineering teams building LLM-integrated applications
- research organizations conducting reproducible benchmarking

RIS v1.0 is model-agnostic and does not mandate the use of any specific framework or vendor. LCAC (Least-Context Access Control) is referenced solely as an example of a compliant reference implementation. RIS remains an independent, neutral specification applicable to any LLM or cognitive system.

Future revisions may expand the standard to include coherence metrics, multi-agent interference scoring, predictive trust modeling, and additional benchmark suites. Atom Labs invites the research, standards, and enterprise community to review, adopt, and contribute to future versions.
