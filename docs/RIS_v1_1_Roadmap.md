# RIS v1.1 Roadmap
Reasoning Integrity Standard (RIS)  
Planned Release: TBD  
Maintained by Atom Labs

---

# 1. Purpose

This roadmap outlines proposed enhancements for RIS v1.1.  
It is **non-normative** and intended for:

- future specification development  
- community proposals  
- governance review  
- working group discussions  

---

# 2. Guiding Principles

RIS v1.1 SHALL focus on:

- extending metrics  
- improving clarity  
- supporting more complex deployment environments  
- enhancing risk modeling  
- strengthening evaluation repeatability  
- adding optional profiles  

---

# 3. Proposed Additions for v1.1

## 3.1 Metric Extensions

- temporal coherence metric  
- reasoning-chain compression score  
- multi-model consistency metric  
- cross-perturbation semantic alignment measurement  

## 3.2 Risk Model Enhancements

- multi-agent interference scoring  
- RAG (retrieval) interference scoring  
- scenario-based drift modeling  
- anomaly detection for emergent reasoning paths  

## 3.3 Evaluation Method Extensions

- adversarial perturbation tests (optional)  
- large-sample bootstrapping guidance  
- randomized stress tests  
- multi-turn evaluation methodology  
- agentic workflow evaluation methodology  

## 3.4 Governance & Controls

- new control family: Agent Interaction Controls (AIC)  
- expanded boundary enforcement rules for RAG systems  
- stricter definitions for memory-based drift  

---

# 4. Proposed New Documents

- RIS Multi-Agent Profile  
- RIS RAG Profile  
- RIS Safety-Critical Profile  
- RIS Temporal Assessment Guide  
- RIS Scenario Benchmark Suite  
- RIS Adversarial Evaluation Guide  

---

# 5. Clarifications & Editorial Improvements

- improved definitions of drift categories  
- formal mathematical notation in measurement framework  
- updated diagrams and reference flows  
- cross-referencing improvements across sections  

---

# 6. Backward Compatibility

RIS v1.1 is intended to be:

- fully backward-compatible with v1.0  
- additive, not breaking  
- optional upgrades for existing evaluators  

RIS v2.0 will be the first version with major breaking changes.

---

# 7. Timeline (Tentative)

- Working Draft: 2–3 months  
- Internal Review: after draft  
- Public Review (optional): 30 days  
- Final Release: TBD  

---

# 8. Participation

Atom Labs MAY invite:

- enterprise governance teams  
- researchers  
- standards bodies  
- regulator observers  
- industry partners  

to propose changes for v1.1.

# 9. Version
