# Reasoning Integrity Standard (RIS)

The Reasoning Integrity Standard defines the first formal, measurable framework for evaluating the stability, predictability, and structural reliability of AI reasoning. It provides a consistent language, methodology, and set of controls for assessing reasoning behavior in large language models, autonomous agents, and multi-model cognitive systems.

RIS is designed for organizations that require dependable reasoning: enterprises, research labs, safety-critical environments, and regulated sectors where uncontrolled variability is unacceptable.

## The Purpose of RIS

Existing AI governance frameworks focus on security, privacy, or compliance. None measure whether an AI system can **reason consistently**.

Modern AI systems often show:

- unstable reasoning chains  
- sensitivity to small prompt or context changes  
- drift over time or across sessions  
- inconsistent multi-step logical structure  
- variance across repeated evaluations  

RIS addresses this gap by providing a reproducible, implementation-agnostic standard for reasoning integrity.

## What RIS Provides

RIS v1.0 delivers a complete, operational framework including:

### Classification Model  
A five-level system (RIS-0 through RIS-4) defining reasoning stability and maturity.

### Measurement Framework  
Five core dimensions of reasoning integrity:  
- Chain Stability  
- Semantic Coherence  
- Drift Sensitivity  
- Variance Envelope Compliance  
- Boundary Governance  

### Governance Controls  
Mandatory controls specifying how systems must behave to qualify for each RIS level.

### Evaluation Methodology  
A structured process for running benchmarks, capturing evidence, and generating scorecards.

### Reference Implementation  
LCAC (Least-Context Access Control) demonstrates how RIS can be implemented in production systems.

### Documentation and Evidence  
Complete templates, glossaries, mappings, reports, and audit guidelines.

## Practical Benchmarking and Evaluation

RIS includes a full benchmarking toolkit capable of:

- running evaluations on individual or multiple models  
- generating JSON and Markdown scorecards  
- producing RIS level badges  
- populating leaderboards  
- computing comparative reasoning metrics  
- generating Cognitive Integrity Index (CII) summaries  

Available analytic resources:

- RIS Reports  
- RIS Leaderboard  
- RIS Badges  
- CII Summaries  

These resources demonstrate how RIS evaluations appear in practice and how reasoning stability can be compared across models.

## Integration and Deployment

RIS is model-agnostic and architecture-agnostic. It can be integrated into:

- existing evaluation pipelines  
- CI/CD systems  
- agentic frameworks  
- enterprise governance programs  
- research workflows  
- vendor benchmarking processes  

Documentation includes:

- Integration Guide  
- API Integration Guide  
- SDK Guide  
- Benchmark Guide  
- Example Prompt Dataset  
- Directory, Report, and Scorecard Schemas  

---

## Who RIS Is Designed For

RIS supports a wide range of organizations:

- enterprise AI teams  
- safety and risk management groups  
- internal audit and compliance functions  
- engineering and MLOps teams  
- research labs and academic institutions  
- model vendors and service providers  
- regulated sectors requiring reproducible evidence  

Any system where reasoning stability matters benefits from RIS classification.
