Reasoning Integrity Standard (RIS)  
Atom Labs - Strategic Roadmap  
Version: 1.0  
Last Updated: 2025

## 1. Purpose

This roadmap defines the long-term evolution of the Reasoning Integrity Standard (RIS).  
It is designed to guide:

- enterprises adopting RIS  
- researchers  
- AI labs  
- regulators  
- vendors  
- evaluators  
- public-sector stakeholders  

The roadmap outlines major initiatives planned for the RIS ecosystem across multiple phases.

# 2. Roadmap Structure

The RIS ecosystem roadmap is divided into three horizons:

1. **Horizon 1: Foundation (0-6 months)**  
2. **Horizon 2: Expansion (6-18 months)**  
3. **Horizon 3: Maturity (18-36 months)**  

Each horizon includes goals for standards, tooling, governance, and ecosystem growth.

---

# 3. Horizon 1 - Foundation (0-6 Months)

RIS v1.0 establishes the baseline standard.  
Key objectives:

## 3.1 Standard Stabilization
- Publish RIS v1.0 documentation  
- Establish governance charter  
- Set up RIS public site (static documentation)  
- Begin community feedback cycle  

## 3.2 Tooling Foundations
- Define RIS scorecard schema  
- Define certification entry schema  
- Define directory schema  
- Publish SDK guide and integration guides  

## 3.3 Adoption Enablement
- Publish adoption kit  
- Publish integration pathways  
- Release benchmark guide  
- Support internal enterprise pilots  

## 3.4 Governance Activities
- Begin collecting proposals for RIS v1.1  
- Maintain change log and index  
- Begin drafting industry profiles (informative)

---

# 4. Horizon 2 - Expansion (6-18 Months)

This is where RIS moves from an emerging standard to a widely adopted, auditable framework.

## 4.1 Standards Development
- Release RIS v1.1 (fully backward compatible)  
- Add multi-agent and RAG-specific profiles  
- Expand drift and variance methodologies  
- Introduce cross-model consistency metrics  

## 4.2 Public Infrastructure
- Launch RIS dynamic portal (v1)  
- Publish public directory of certified systems  
- Publish RIS scorecards for reference models  
- Enable organization-level certification listings  

## 4.3 Tooling & Evaluators
- Release RIS open-source reference evaluator (optional)
- Release RIS Python evaluation toolkit  
- Enable command-line RIS evaluation workflows  
- Optional: provide sample datasets for standardized benchmarking  

## 4.4 Regulatory & Enterprise Alignment
- Map RIS to more regulatory frameworks  
- Partner with enterprise governance teams for structured usage  
- Begin liaison work with external standards bodies  

---

# 5. Horizon 3 - Maturity (18-36 Months)

RIS becomes a global reasoning integrity benchmark.

## 5.1 Standards Maturation
- Release RIS v2.0 (may introduce breaking changes)
- Formalize coherence fingerprinting methods  
- Formalize predictive drift models  
- Introduce reasoning-route compression metrics  
- Release scenario-based benchmark suites  

## 5.2 Full Ecosystem Tools
- RIS certification testing suite  
- RIS auditor toolkit  
- RIS validator for CI/CD pipelines  
- RIS dashboard for drift & stability monitoring  

## 5.3 Public Portal Expansion
- Public RIS leaderboard  
- RIS certification badge directory  
- Model-version lineage tracking  
- Long-term drift benchmark archives  
- Public scorecard submission tools  

## 5.4 Ecosystem Governance
- Establish the RIS Technical Steering Committee (TSC)
- Multi-organization participation  
- Formal voting process for version changes  
- External auditor network

# 6. RIS Ecosystem Vision

The long-term goal of RIS is to become:

- the **de facto global standard** for reasoning integrity  
- a **regulator-ready** measurement framework  
- a foundation for **multi-agent safety and auditing**  
- a **neutral, implementation-agnostic** benchmark  
- a standard that is adopted by:
  - Fortune 100 enterprises  
  - public-sector institutions  
  - AI labs  
  - safety organizations  
  - open-source communities  

RIS is designed to be:

- durable  
- transparent  
- stable  
- future-proof  
- vendor-neutral  

---

# 7. Summary

The RIS ecosystem roadmap guides RIS from its initial specification into a fully governed, widely adopted, cross-industry integrity framework.

This roadmap is updated periodically to reflect:

- technological changes  
- regulatory development  
- industry feedback  
- academic research  
- practical usage patterns
